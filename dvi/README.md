# BrickGame v1.0 aka Tetris

BrickGame v1.0 is a console-based Tetris game developed in C using the ncurses library. It features a classic Tetris gameplay experience with additional mechanics such as score counting, level progression, and high score tracking.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay with the following mechanics:
    - Rotation of tetrominoes
    - Horizontal movement of tetrominoes
    - Accelerated tetromino falling (by holding the down arrow key)
    - Display of the next tetromino
    - Line clearing
    - Game over when the tetromino reaches the top of the game field
- Support for all physical buttons on the console:
    - Start game - Enter
    - Pause - P
    - End game - Esc
    - Left arrow - move tetromino left
    - Right arrow - move tetromino right
    - Down arrow - accelerate tetromino falling
    - Up arrow - rotate tetromino
- Matrix-based game field with dimensions corresponding to the console's size (10x20 pixels)
- Proper stopping of tetrominoes after reaching the bottom or colliding with another tetromino
- Unit tests for the game logic library, achieving at least 90% code coverage

## Additional Mechanics

### Score Calculation

- 1 line cleared: 100 points
- 2 lines cleared: 300 points
- 3 lines cleared: 700 points
- 4 lines cleared: 1500 points

### High Score Tracking

- Display of the player's current score and highest score achieved
- Highest score is stored in a file or embedded database and persists between game sessions

### Level Progression

- Progression of levels every 600 points
- Increasing level increases the speed of tetromino falling
